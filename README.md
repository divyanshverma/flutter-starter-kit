# Fullter Starter Kit

Build what you can imagine!

# Background

I have been building flutter apps for a while and never found a all in one kit that can help fast track app development.
So I have put together this repo to share a starter kit which provides:

1. Basic Auth Mechanism
2. Drawers
3. Tabs
4. Nested Tabs
5. Camera
6. File Opener
7. File Reader
8. Lists
9. Layout Ideas
10. TUS Uploader (Future Roadmap)
11. MQTT Client (Future Roadmap)
12. More to come...

Please feel free to use and provide feedback.
